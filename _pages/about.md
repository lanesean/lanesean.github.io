Hello, my name is Sean Lane. I attend Michigan State University as a Computer Science major with a large passion for software engineering and mathematics. My drive is to excel and expand what I currently understand about software design and machine learning both inside and outside of my academic career. I am looking to further my learning with opportunities to research in fields of machine learning, data science, and robotics.

In my free time I enjoy reading or watching content on new technological or scientific advances in the world. Keeping up to date with this exponentially growing world is something I keep myself attuned to as I do not want to fall behind. I am a member of the MSU autonomous vehicles club that gives support to learning more software integration in machine autonomy, helping research and support the clubs autonomous vehicle. The MSU AI club is another club that I am an active member in. My goal after my undergraduate degree is to pursue a career as a software engineer/developer.
